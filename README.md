# Java - java.lang.Object

## Questions
What is a canonical class name?

Answer: It is the class name of an object including the package name.

Why is it not possible to call methods on a null reference?

Answer: "null" says there exists no object. If there is no object then there are no methods that can be called.

## Excercise
As an excercise, we will create our own base class that provides some hopefully useful methods

- a property that uniquely identifies any object instance
- a parent property to designate order of objects
- have an implementation for equals() and hashCode()
